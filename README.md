Street Smart provides Los Angeles natives, explorers, and college students a stunning visual database of LA neighborhoods and their relative "walkability scores". This streamlined interface allows for easy searching and reviewing. While other map applications provide the quickest walking route to a destination, this provides the background safety check of the area you are about to explore.
